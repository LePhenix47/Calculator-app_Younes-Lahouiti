# Calculator-app_Younes-Lahouiti

This repo contains the code of a calculator I made (WITHOUT using the JS native eval() function because of how unsafe it is) The calculator is just a little bit broken

_There's only 1 issue_

If the equation is very long, the outputted result might be equal to "NaN" (aka "Not a number")

Though in the console in the DevTools you can see the result of the equation
