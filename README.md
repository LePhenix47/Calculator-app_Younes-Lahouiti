# Calculator-app_Younes-Lahouiti
This repo contains the code of a calculator I made (WITHOUT using the JS native eval() function because of how unsafe it is) The calculator is just a little bit broken

There's only 1 issue

Any addition or substraction on the beginning of the equation will also give a NaN
